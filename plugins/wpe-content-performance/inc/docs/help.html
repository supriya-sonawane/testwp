<p>WP Engine Content Performance allows you to look at your WordPress siteâ€™s performance in terms of the following Google Analytics metrics.</p>
<p>See the links in the &quot;Additional Resources&quot; section below for more information on these metrics and how to improve them.</p>

<tr class="">
<td>Unique Page Views</td>
<td>ga:uniquePageviews</td>
<td>The number of sessions during which the specified page was viewed at least once. <br><br>Note: A unique page view is counted for each page URL and page title combination.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="alternate">
<td>Page Views</td>
<td>ga:pageviews</td>
<td>The total number of page views for the property.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="">
<td>Users</td>

</tr>
<tr class="alternate">

<td>ga:newUsers</td>
<td>The number of new users to visit the property.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="">
<td>Sessions</td>
<td>ga:sessions</td>
<td>The total number of sessions.<br><br>Note: Google Analytics only computes this value for the first page entered in a session.  Consider using Unique Page Views as a proxy to get an accurate count of sessions for your selected report filters.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="alternate">
<td>Bounce Rate (%)</td>
<td>ga:bounces / ga:sessions</td>
<td>The percentage of single-page sessions (i.e., sessions in which the user left the property from the first page visited). <br><br>Note: Bounce rate can be impacted by other events, such as live chat or video auto-plays.  Consider setting these events as &quot;non-interaction.&quot; Otherwise, the way Google Analytics computes bounces and sends multiple engagement hits might lead to lower bounce rates than actuals.</td>

<td>The average number of pages viewed during a session, including repeated views of a single page.</td>
